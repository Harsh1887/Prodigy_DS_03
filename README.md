# üíº Decision Tree Classifier ‚Äì Bank Marketing

A machine learning project designed to predict customer subscription behavior to term deposits using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The project utilizes the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and showcases end-to-end data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## üìå Overview

This project explores how demographic and behavioral attributes influence a client's likelihood of subscribing to a bank's term deposit. It applies Decision Tree algorithms to model the classification problem and evaluate its performance using standard metrics.

## üìä Dataset Information

- **Source**: [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)  
- **Instances**: 41,188 client records  
- **Objective**: Predict the binary target variable `y` ‚Äî whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`)
